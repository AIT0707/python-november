# Code 1
if 10 > 5:
print("Ten is greater than five!")
#It gives error because of absence of the identation in the third line. Below the correct rewrited code snippet.
if 10>5:
    print ("Ten is greater than five!")

# Code 2
if 8 > 3:
    print("Eight is greater than three!")
    print("Indeed!")
# The Code 2 snippet is correct as both print lines here started with the same number of spaces. 

# Code 3
a = 7
b = 3
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("b is greater than a")
# The Code 3 snippet is correct as in each blocks the print lines have identations.

Indentation is a very important concept in Python because it defines the grouping of codes. 
True indentation is necessary to avoid syntax errors and ensure code works correctly. 
Unlike other programming languages that use curly braces, parentheses, or keywords to separate blocks of code, 
Python uses indentation to highlight them. This approach make a code easy to read and simplifies code structure.
