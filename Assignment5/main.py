# Code 1
if 10 > 5:
print("Ten is greater than five!")
#It gives an error because of the absence of the indentation in the third line. Below the correct rewrited code snippet.
if 10>5:
    print ("Ten is greater than five!")

# Code 2
if 8 > 3:
    print("Eight is greater than three!")
    print("Indeed!")
# The Code 2 snippet is correct as both print lines here started with the same number of spaces. 

# Code 3
a = 7
b = 3
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("b is greater than a")
# The Code 3 snippet is correct as in each blocks the print lines have indentations. 

"""
Indentation is a very important concept in Python because it defines the grouping of codes. 
True indentation is necessary to avoid syntax errors and ensure code works correctly. 
Other programming languages use curly braces or keywords to separate blocks of code, where
Python uses indentation to highlight them. This approach makes a code easy to read and simplifies code structure.
