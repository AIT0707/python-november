'''
a. Create a Python program that defines two variables with numerical values and performs the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulo (Remainder)
'''
#Addition. This operator (+) is used to define the sum of numeric values.
x = 12
y = 21
print (x + y)  # Output 33

# Subtraction. This operator (-) is used to define the difference of numeric values.
x = 12
y = 21
print (y - x)  # Output 9

# Multiplication. This operator (*) is used to define the product of numeric values.
x = 12
y = 21
print (y * x)  # Output 252

# Division. This operator (/) is used to define the quotient of numeric values.
x = 12
y = 21
print (y / x)  # Output 1.75

#Modulo (Remainder). This operator (%) is used to define the remainder after the division of setted variables.
x = 12
y = 21
print (x % y)  # Output 12
