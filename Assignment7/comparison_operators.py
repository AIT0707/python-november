'''
a. Write a program that compares two numbers (you can directly assign values to the variables) using the following comparison operators:
- Greater than
- Less than
- Equal to
- Not equal to
- Greater than or equal to
- Less than or equal to
'''
# Greater than
x = 21
y = 12
print (x > y) # Output: True - because 21 greater than 12

# Less than
x = 21
y = 12
print (y < x) # Output: True - because 12 less than 21

# Equal to
x = 12
y = 12
print (x == y) # Output: True - because 12 is equal to 12

# Not equal to
x = 21
y = 12
print (x != y) # Output: True - because 21 is not equal to 12

# Greater than or equal to
x = 21
y = 12
print (x >= y) # Output: True - because 21 is greater than 12

# Less than or equal to
x = 21
y = 12
print (y <= x) # Output: True - because 12 is less than 21
